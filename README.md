# Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning Techniques

<a name="proj_desc"></a>
## Project Description

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for skin cancer classification. The dataset that was used in this project consists of various skin lesion images, where each is associated with a specific type of skin cancer or lesion. Furthermore, the dataset also includes metadata containing personal information such as age and gender of the patients.

## Dataset Details
- The dataset comprises images from the HAM10000 competition (Human against Machines).
- Each image corresponds to a specific skin cancer type, categorized as follows:
    - **Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec)**
    - **Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)**
    - **Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)**
    - **Dermatofibroma (df)**
    - **Melanoma (mel)**
    - **Melanocytic nevi (nv)**
    - **Vascular lesions (vasc)**

## Project Objective

Our task was to build a deep learning model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) that is able to accurately classify unseen images of skin lesions/cancer.
